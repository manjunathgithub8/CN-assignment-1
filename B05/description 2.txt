output file- etag.txt

capture file : wireshark capture Etag.pcapng

working:
        * curl command is used to get the http request headers.
        * curl -I is used for only displaying headers
        * http://goidirectory.nic.in is used for input example
   

challenges faced: * we found that mostly apache servers use Etag.
                  * initially couldn't capture https(secure) websites, 
                     hence had to capture websites of http(not seccure)
                  * different team members tried different sites like https://www.BBC.com 
                     which was a http2 sites. we could verify by changing the etag value to get 200 code

topics learnt: few curl commands, Etag and how browers use Etag for checking modification in webpage and load accordingly
               how caching is done in browser.
